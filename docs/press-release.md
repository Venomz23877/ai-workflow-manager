# Press Release Draft — AI Workflow Manager Launch Day

**For Immediate Release**

**Actual Outcomes Announces AI Workflow Manager: A Desktop Platform for Designing and Running Agentic AI Workflows**

_November 14, 2025 – Remote_ — Actual Outcomes LLC today unveiled AI Workflow Manager, a cross-platform desktop application that empowers teams to design, run, and refine AI-driven workflows without writing code. Built with Electron and React, the app combines a visual workflow designer, a powerful CLI, and secure local storage to help organizations operationalize large language models alongside customizable business logic.

“Teams are ready to move beyond one-off prompts,” said Natalie Carter, Head of Product at Actual Outcomes. “AI Workflow Manager gives them a structure—a way to drag a Decision node onto a canvas, plug in their policy prompts, and connect it to a Loop that iterates until the output meets their standards. It’s the missing bridge between imagination and repeatable AI operations.”

## Build Workflows as Living Diagrams

Users land on a dashboard where every workflow feels like a living artifact. From there they dive into the Visual Designer, dragging node types—Decision, WorkStep, Loop—onto a grid. Entry and exit actions narrate what each step will do, triggers fire transitions as soon as validators pass, and the canvas scales from simple automations to multi-team playbooks. Undo/redo, validation hints, and inline guidance ensure even first-time authors stay on track.

## Run, Monitor, and Collaborate

When a workflow runs, the Action Console lights up with real-time status: AI responses stream in, document generation progress bars fill, and validators confirm transitions. Colleagues can trigger actions directly from the UI or through the CLI companion, which mirrors functionality with structured logs for automation pipelines. Document workspaces let users edit Markdown, HTML, JSON, YAML, and CSV templates, then export final deliverables as DOCX or PDF using the bundled libraries.

## Plug In the AI Stack You Already Trust

AI Workflow Manager ships with connectors for OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude. Users enter their API keys once, test connections with a playground prompt, and switch models per workflow when needed. The connector pattern extends to storage and files, so the default SQLite database can be swapped for remote services as teams scale. Every credential is stored securely via OS keychain integration, giving IT confidence in compliance.

## Built for Teams Who Need Control

- **Visual + CLI parity** for hybrid GUI/scripting workflows.
- **Document generation** with `docx` and `pdf-lib`, plus inline editing for HTML/Markdown.
- **Local-first architecture** so sensitive data stays on the machine by default.
- **Extensible connectors** that follow documented interfaces for rapid integration with new systems.
- **Secure credential vault** and sandboxed filesystem access, with the ability to whitelist directories.
- **Comprehensive templates** and personas, helping teams launch with examples like Sales Playbooks, Policy Reviews, and Marketing Iteration Labs.

“Our compliance pilot took less than a week,” said Marcus Lee, Director of Risk Operations at early adopter Horizon Lending. “We dragged nodes onto the canvas, plugged in our policies, and our analysts were running nightly checks through the CLI. It’s exactly what we needed to scale AI safely.”

## Availability

AI Workflow Manager is available today for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Teams can download installers and explore documentation—including architecture, workflow engine, UX narratives, and connector contracts—at **actualoutcomes.com/ai-workflow-manager**.
