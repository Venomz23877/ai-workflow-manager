description: GitHub CLI usage protocol for PR, commit, and branching workflows—default to the CLI without re-confirmation once requested.
alwaysApply: true
steps: |
  1. Acknowledge the request and confirm CLI readiness: run `gh auth status`; re-auth immediately if it fails.
  2. Draft a task-specific plan in `.ai_working/` (goals, CLI command sequence, rollback strategy). Unless essential details are missing, proceed without asking the user again to confirm CLI usage.
  3. Confirm prerequisites (clean working tree, correct branch, required environment variables) and note them in the plan before execution.
  4. Execute the documented `gh`/`git` commands promptly, updating the plan with actual outcomes, deviations, or blockers in real time. Only pause to ask the user if additional data is required to continue.
  5. When communicating git or GitHub CLI actions, prefix chat messages with the clipboard emoji (`📋`) so collaborators know commands are being run.
  6. Upon completion, summarize results and outstanding actions in the plan doc and cross-link updates in `.ai_working/wrapup.md` if follow-up is required.
recommendedCommands: |
  - `gh pr status` / `gh pr list` to select the correct PR context.
  - `gh pr checkout <id>` to sync the PR branch locally.
  - `gh pr view <id> --web` for quick context pivots.
  - `gh pr checks <id>` or `gh run watch` to monitor CI state.
  - `gh repo set-default <org>/<repo>` to avoid cross-repo mistakes.
  - `gh alias list` to verify the command surface and avoid surprises.
postExecution: |
  - Ensure local and remote branches stay aligned (`git status`, `git branch -vv`).
  - Capture follow-up tasks, blockers, or approvals needed in the plan doc for the next session.
  - Remove temporary files that are no longer needed; promote long-term docs out of `.ai_working/`.
