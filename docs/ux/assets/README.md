# UX Asset Inventory

Given the shift away from external design tools, this directory tracks any supplementary artifacts that complement the in-repo narratives and code prototypes.

## Current Policy

- Primary UX deliverables remain narrative markdown, ASCII sketches, and coded prototypes.
- No external design files (Figma, Sketch, etc.) are required; if future screenshots or diagrams are needed, store them here and document their source.
- Maintain a manifest (`manifest.json` when needed) mapping asset files to the narrative or prototype they support.

## Suggested Uses

- ASCII diagram snippets that are reused across screens.
- PNG captures of coded prototypes for quick reference (only when necessary).
- Typography/color tokens exported from CSS modules if a design token sheet is produced.

## Pending Tasks

- [ ] Decide whether any reusable ASCII diagrams should live as separate snippets.
- [ ] Capture design tokens (colors, typography) once the styling system is defined.
- [ ] Document process for exporting screenshots from coded prototypes when required.

This README will evolve alongside the narrative UX documentation and prototypes.
