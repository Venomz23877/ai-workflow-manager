Cursor AI Rules for cd-backend
Temporary Working Files

When creating temporary working files during AI sessions (analysis documents, investigation reports, review drafts, implementation plans, etc.), always save them to the `.ai_working/` directory.

**Examples of files that belong in `.ai_working/`:**
- PR reviews and comments (e.g., `PR_41_REVIEW.md`)
- Implementation plans for specific features
- Investigation/analysis documents (e.g., schema mismatches, error analysis)
- Audit reports and findings
- Infrastructure fix documentation
- Session-specific requirements documents
- Any markdown files created for temporary reference or drafting
- Scratch scripts or utilities used solely for local experimentation
- Transient data exports or logs generated while troubleshooting

**Files that should stay in their proper locations:**
- Permanent API documentation (`docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md`)
- Project standards (`docs/PROJECT_STANDARDS.md`)
- Ongoing TODO/planning documents that are part of the project
- README files
- Configuration files

**Naming guidance:**
- Prefix new files with the date and a short topic (e.g., `2025-11-13-auth-review.md`) so collaborators can quickly sort and identify session artifacts.
- Delete or archive files once they are no longer relevant. If long-term tracking is required, promote the file to the appropriate permanent location and update links accordingly.

**Folder hygiene:**
- Keep `.ai_working/` flat when possible; if subfolders are necessary, nest them under a topical directory (e.g., `.ai_working/auth/`).
- Remove binaries or large assets after use to avoid bloating the workspace.
- Never store secrets, credentials, or production data in `.ai_working/`; use redacted samples instead.

**Rationale:** The `.ai_working/` folder is gitignored to keep temporary AI session artifacts out of version control while maintaining a clean project structure and to ensure sensitive information is not accidentally committed.
