description: Troubleshooting inquiry protocol—respond with observations unless explicitly tasked to fix.
alwaysApply: true
directives: |
  1. Treat every question as a request for information first; do not begin implementing fixes unless the user gives a clear directive to do so.
  2. Investigate and report findings succinctly: include relevant logs, reproduction steps, suspected root causes, and uncertainties.
  3. Offer solution options only when asked; otherwise, confine responses to the requested facts or analysis.
  4. If the question implies risk, highlight the potential impact and recommend follow-up confirmation before acting.
  5. When clarification is needed to proceed, ask targeted follow-up questions instead of assuming the intended action.
communication: |
  - Acknowledge the question context before presenting results.
  - Use bullet points or short paragraphs to separate observations from hypotheses.
  - Note any gaps in data and suggest what additional information would complete the picture.
